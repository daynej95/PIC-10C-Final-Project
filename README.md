# PIC-10C-Final-Project

I am interested in the relationship between prime numbers and the rest of the natural numbers.
In this project I want to explore that relationship.
I want to write code that checks if an int is prime, breaks an int down into its prime factors, and more.
I'm not sure yet what exactly the extent of this project will be. I want to explore and see where it takes me.
